1. Introduction
The research paper compares the performance of constant and dynamic volatility scaling approaches in risk-adjusted momentum strategies. Specifically, the paper focuses on momentum strategies in financial markets and examines the use of volatility scaling methods to manage risk. The performance of these strategies is tested in a diversified portfolio of 55 global liquid futures contracts. The study also analyzes the impact of volatility on the scaling of momentum signals.

2. Data & Methodology
The researchers collected monthly prices from 55 global liquid futures instruments from June 1986 to May 2017. The portfolio consisted of commodity contracts, sovereign bond contracts, currency contracts, and equity index contracts. Various sources such as Bloomberg, London Metal Exchange, Intercontinental Exchange, Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Chicago Board of Trade, New York Commodity Exchange, Tokyo Commodity Exchange, and K. French's website were utilized to gather the data. Descriptive statistics of the original series, including annualized means and standard deviations, were summarized.

The methodology involved calculating the returns for the XSMOM strategy and estimating volatility. The XSMOM strategy involved longing the top-performing decile and shorting the bottom decile over a 6-month look-back period. The researchers implemented the strategy when there were at least 45 contracts available in the dataset. Two volatility scaling approaches were introduced: Constant Volatility Scaling Approach (CVS) and Dynamic Volatility Scaling Approach (DVS), which control the weight of each instrument based on its volatility. The study also included two benchmarks: buy-and-hold and Time Series Momentum (TSMOM) strategies, which are equally weighted or adjusted for volatility.

3. Results
The empirical results section begins by discussing momentum crashes in futures markets, defined as periods where the cumulative returns of the bottom decile are significantly higher than the cumulative returns of the top decile. The researchers analyzed momentum crashes using the XSMOM strategy from 1991 to 2017 and identified a momentum crash during the 2007-2008 financial crisis. 

The study then compared the performance of the CVS and DVS approaches in reducing momentum losses during financial stress. The researchers divided the sample period into pre-crisis, crisis, and post-crisis sub-periods. They regressed the returns of the CVS and DVS XSMOM strategies on market indices and risk factors and found that both strategies had statistically significant alphas. The CVS strategy had a slightly higher alpha than the DVS strategy, indicating better abnormal returns. 

When comparing the performance of the CVS and DVS strategies in different sub-periods, the researchers found that both strategies had statistically significant alphas during the pre-crisis sub-period. However, during the crisis and post-crisis sub-periods, the alphas became insignificant. Overall, the CVS strategy outperformed the DVS strategy, with a statistically significant difference in alphas. However, this difference became narrower during the crisis and post-crisis periods, suggesting that the performance of the DVS strategy improved during these periods.

The study concluded that the CVS-based XSMOM strategy was the most profitable among the tested strategies, despite having larger risk and drawdown. The CVS approach was determined to be a more efficient volatility scaling method for momentum strategies in futures markets. However, it was noted that the CVS approach carried higher risks, and future research should focus on identifying the source of this risk and finding ways to mitigate it.

### PDF LLM 
This small project uses Langchain to summarise and ask questions to PDFs.

to start you need to add a keys.py file which contains the API_KEY variable. \
This is the OpenAI API key that you can find here: https://platform.openai.com/

Once you have added your API key, check out the example.ipynb notebook. Here I \
go over the basics of the PdfLLMRefine class and how to:
* how to ask questions to a PDF
* summarise the PDF
* save the summary as a tex file.
\
Also, check out the **fmom_summaries** directory for some example summaries. The \
papers can be found in **factor_momentum_papers**
